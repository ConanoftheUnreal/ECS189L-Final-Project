    /// This class illustrates how to combine Polarith.AI with Unity's state - and root motion mechanism. It acts as an
    /// example and may be altered, improved or maybe used as base for more elaborate implementations for specific
    /// animation controllers. By combining Polarith AI and root motion mechanics different animation states like idle,
    /// walk and run are easily manageable with just a few lines.
    /// <para/>
    /// This implementation does two things. First, the character is aligned along the direction received by <see
    /// cref="AIMContext.DecidedDirection"/>. Second, a simple float parameter is passed to the <see cref="Animator"/>
    /// to provide a hint how fast the character should move. This way, the different animation states, like idle or
    /// walking are managed by the animation controller like it should be. Further information can be found here,
    /// https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/AnimationStateMachines.html. The actual movement of the character is done by the
    /// root motion mechanics (https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/RootMotion.html).
    /// <para/>
    /// A prerequisite is of course a fitting animation controller setup, like the SimpleWalkCycle.controller in the
    /// Polarith AI package.

    /// Note, this is just a script for our example scenes and, therefore, not part of the actual API. We do not
