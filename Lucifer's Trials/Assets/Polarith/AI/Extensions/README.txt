The scripts in the archive contained in the Extension directory of the Unity Asset Store packages
can easily download and integrate the sources of the Polarith AI Formation extension into your
project. For this to work properly, your project needs to have Polarith AI installed with the
default directory structure (coming as it is from the Unity Asset Store).

In case you use a custom directory structure, you should not use these scripts. Instead, you can
integrate the sources yourself. Therefore, you can find the source code on GitHub
(https://github.com/polarith/AI-Formation).
