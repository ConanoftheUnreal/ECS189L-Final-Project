## User Interface

**Describe your user interface and how it relates to gameplay. This can be done via the template.**

**Gabriel**: The first thing I worked on was our [*basic Health UI and Player Health logic*](https://github.com/ConanoftheUnreal/ECS189L-Final-Project/pull/1/commits/f6cc07bd75ee0240c0b03ea9b98741923844212d) and our [SP gauge and pickups](https://github.com/ConanoftheUnreal/ECS189L-Final-Project/pull/9/commits/2124ede148abe5cac5cf76317390345ae58ce1c7). The health later got put into a combined script with the players' stats and we had to scrap our SP and special moves idea due to time, so they are no longer in the main code. I also made the [*Main Menu*](https://github.com/ConanoftheUnreal/ECS189L-Final-Project/pull/20/commits/0a28bf8d3c38e591699c73437c429a926081b3fc), [*Death Screen*](https://github.com/ConanoftheUnreal/ECS189L-Final-Project/pull/22/commits/77b9cbf9a165519e2fff8632cb5730984df5ff60), and [*Pause Menu*](https://github.com/ConanoftheUnreal/ECS189L-Final-Project/pull/28/commits/f6425f45a00762792696b23a8cb5371d5b6a18e1). These additions were all complete with working buttons that either change the scene or use a script to add or remove components in the Canvas. 

I used the following tutorials for my User Interface contributions:

- [Basic start menu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RIsfVOqTaE)

## Press Kit and Trailer

**Describe how you showcased your work. How did you choose what to show in the trailer? Why did you choose your screenshots?**

**Gabriel**: One thing I kept in mind while making the presskit was that I wanted it to be on a **website** where users can look at the game's screenshots, the trailer, and descriptions of the game all in one area. I decided to use itch.io since it met all of these requirements, while also being easy to set up. For the trailer, I used [OBS](https://obsproject.com/) to record all of the clips, and Microsoft ClipChamp to edit it all together. In the trailer, I wanted to show all of the important features of our game including combat, gold pickups, purchasing upgrades, the two classes, and I finally wanted to show that the dungeon is big and different every time. I explicitly recorded fast-paced clips that captured the difficulty and fast mechanics one must have to beat a room (at least as a knight). Similarly, I chose the screenshots for the same reason. I wanted to show off combat, the prerun area, and the shop GUI.
